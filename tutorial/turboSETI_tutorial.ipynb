    "# Usage of [`turboSETI`](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti)\n",
    "Updated 2020-08-06 by Shane Smith (ssmith3@hillsdale.edu)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "## Intro\n",
    "`turboSETI` is a Python tool used and developed by SETI researchers at the [Berkeley SETI Research Center](https://seti.berkeley.edu). The alogorithm searches for narrow band signals which have a doppler drift, a feature expected to be seen from an alien source with a non-zero acceleration relative to our recievers on Earth. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "A basic introduction on installation and usage is given on `turboSETI`'s [README.md on GitHub](https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti/blob/master/README.md). This tutorial intends to give a more comprehensive look at the usage of the tools contained in `turboSETI`. <br/>\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two ways of getting access to `turboSETI`.\n",
    "1) If you are ssh'd into the BL data center, you can access a recent version by running `source /opt/conda/init.sh` in the terminal.\n",
    "- A recent version of `turboSETI` should also be installed on the default Python3 kernel on the BL Jupyter Lab server.\n",
    "\n",
    "2) You can create a new environment with the latest version of `turboSETI`\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are some instructions on creating a new environment and adding it to a Jupyter Notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "First we'll need to set up an anaconda enviornment by running these commands in the bash terminal:\n",
    "- `$ conda deactivate`\n",
    "- `$ conda create -n turboSETI` \n",
    "    - Naming after -n is arbitrary, the name of your environment can be any name you want\n",
    "- `$ conda activate turboSETI`\n",
    "- `$ conda install pip`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's install the required packages:\n",
    "- `$ ~/.conda/envs/turboSETI/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/blimpy` \n",
    "    - `~/.conda/envs/turboSETI/bin/pip` is the location of your pip. This may be different depending on your configuration.\n",
    "    - `blimpy` is the file I/O for BL SETI. It will automatically gather all required packages for `turboSETI`\n",
    "- `$ ~/.conda/envs/turboSETI/bin/pip install git+https://github.com/UCBerkeleySETI/turbo_seti`\n",
    "\n",
    "Now we need to install our environment as an `IPython` kernel, so we can use it in Jupyter:\n",
    "- `$ conda install -c anaconda ipykernel`\n",
    "- `$ python -m ipykernel install --user --name=turboSETI`\n",
    "\n",
    "A fresh version of `turboSETI` is now installed in the kernel `turboSETI`. You will have to restart Jupyter to see this kernel and be able to switch over (a quick refresh of the webpage should work).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Creating a Search Routine\n",
    "Now that we have `turboSETI` installed we can start a Doppler drift search on some data. First we want to create a search object using `turbo_seti.find_doppler.find_doppler.FindDoppler()`"
